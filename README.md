# Aydan's Super Sweet League Analysis Project
This is my first project I'm posting on GitHub! Also, It's my first data science project!

## In this project I'll do a few things:
1. Scrape a website called op.gg to get data from my league games.
2. Take what I need and put it into a pandas dataframe.
3. Analyze the data in a jupyter notebook.

## What I hope to learn:
1. I want to become more proficient when it comes to working with the web.
2. I want to familiarize my self with the tools that data scientists use. Jupyter, pandas, matplotlib, etc
3. I want to learn more about statistics and creating insights from them!

# Beware, this is a poorly written beginner project, I'm just having fun!
